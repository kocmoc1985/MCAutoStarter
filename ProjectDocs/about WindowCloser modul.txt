1. OBS! Note that this modul uses "jna.jar" library as it uses "java native"

2. OBS! OBS! Whan it searches for windows the tray icons are also considered as "windows" - this causes
sometimes problems as it was on Federal Mogul -> the driver had an icon in tray which had the same name
as the error window which it shown. So the "WindowCloser" modul couldn't destinguish between the "tray window" 
and the "error message"
